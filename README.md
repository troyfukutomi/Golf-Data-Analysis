# Golf-Data-Analysis
Unsupervised Machine Learning Project

This is my project for Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning. I have use my own golf data that I have collected over the last few months. There are around 1100 swings across 9 different golf clubs. I wanted to create this project with my own data so that I could help myself identify areas of stregth and weakness in my golf game. Using methods like PCA, Kmeans clustering, and Hierarchical clustering I hope to extract useful analysis that can help me improve in the sport. 

For Kmeans clustering there can be a bit of randomness in running this is different machines. So my analysis of k means clustering may not match up excactly to yours if you decide to run it. 

I will include a PDF of my original notebook with my original Kmeans analysis.
